This was our final course project for COMPSCI 690D: Advanced Natural Language Processing. 

Coreference resolution is the task of identifying all mentions of entities and events in text and placing them into equivalence classes. It is a challenging and unsolved problem which is useful for numerous downstream tasks such as question answering, document summarization, and information retrieval.

The goal of our project was two-fold. First, we wanted to obtain theoretical and practical knowledge of the state-of-the-art coreference resolution approaches. Second, we wanted to build our own coreference resolution system which is gender fair. Recently it has been shown (Webster et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018; Rudinger et al., 2018) that current state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems are biased by gender, which may impair their applicability to downstream tasks.
