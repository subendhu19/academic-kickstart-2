title="Proof completion in the formal verification language - Coq"

summary="Formal verification is an important field in Software Engineering and in Computer Science in general. With increasingly complex algorithms and models being implemented in today’s world, verifying their correctness has become that much more important. Formal languages like Coq help us achieve this task by providing us a framework to write proofs. However, the learning curve for these kinds of functional languages is steep since it involves rigorous proofs and the languages have a unique syntax structure. Programmers can use helpful suggestions about what tactics to use while writing their proofs. The aim of this project is to provide these useful suggestions by looking at previous proofs."

Formal verification is an important field in Software Engineering and in Computer Science in general. With increasingly complex algorithms and models being implemented in today’s world, verifying their correctness has become that much more important. Formal languages like Coq help us achieve this task by providing us a framework to write proofs. However, the learning curve for these kinds of functional languages is steep since it involves rigorous proofs and the languages have a unique syntax structure. Programmers can use helpful suggestions about what tactics to use while writing their proofs. The aim of this project is to provide these useful suggestions and also try to automatically complete proofs by learning from previously written proofs.
