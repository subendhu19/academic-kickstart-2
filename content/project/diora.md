This is my primary area of work with Prof. Andrew McCallum and Prof. Mohit Iyyer. We are working on improving DIORA (Deep Inside Outside Representations using Autoencoders), a fully unsupervised method for inducing tree-structure in english sentences based on dynamic programming. I'm currently working on approximating the dynamic program using representating learning and knowledge distillation.

In the past, I worked on a variant of DIORA called S-DIORA, where the soft dynamic program is replaced by a more exact, hard version. This work was in collaboration with Andrew Drozdov and it was published at EMNLP 2020.
