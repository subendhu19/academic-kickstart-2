This is my primary area of work with Prof. Andrew McCallum. We are working on improving DIORA (Deep Inside Outside Representations using Autoencoders), a fully unsupervised method for inducing tree-structure in english sentences based on dynamic programming. My current work is on improving this algorithm by making the original model more complex and applying it to various standard parsing tasks.
