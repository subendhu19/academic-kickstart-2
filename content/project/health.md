Predicting clinical outcomes using longitudinal electronic health record (EHRs) data is a clinically important and computationally challenging task. In this project, we are working on predicting adverse events like patient death, re-admission, bleeding, or heart failure using carefully extracted features from patient records. We explore techniques from both statistical and neural network literature such as repair models, survival analysis, transformer models, and ordinary differential equations.
