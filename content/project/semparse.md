This is my primary area of research with Prof. Andrew McCallum. We are working on improving low resource language understanding in voice assistants. This work is in collaboration with Konstantine Arkoudas and Wael Hamza at Amazon Alexa AI.

We are currently working on zeroshot domain adaptation for task-oriented semantic parsing. Our previous works in this project were published at WWW 2020, AAAI 2021, and IJCAI 2022.
