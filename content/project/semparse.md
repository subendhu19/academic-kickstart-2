This was my primary area of research with Prof. Andrew McCallum and the focus of my dissertation. We worked on improving low resource language understanding in voice assistants. This work was in collaboration with Konstantine Arkoudas and Wael Hamza at Amazon Alexa AI.

Our works in this project were published at WWW 2020, AAAI 2021, and IJCAI 2022, and the final piece of work on zeroshot domain adapation for semantic parsing will be published at EACL 2023.
